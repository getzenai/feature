# Feature Implementation

## Incremental End-to-End Development

- Implement features in small, complete vertical slices that span all necessary layers
- Each increment should be a working, testable piece of functionality
- Verify each increment with builds and tests before proceeding to the next

## Implementation Strategy

- Avoid layer-by-layer development: Don't build complete database schema → complete backend → complete frontend
- Prefer feature-by-feature development: Build one small feature across database → backend → frontend, then test and verify
- Start simple: Begin with the minimal viable implementation of a feature slice
- Expand incrementally: Add complexity and additional features only after the current slice is working

## Verification Between Increments

- Run builds after each increment
- Execute relevant tests to verify the feature slice works end-to-end
- Ensure the application remains functional before adding the next increment
- Fix any issues immediately rather than accumulating technical debt

For a user profile feature requiring database, API, and UI changes:

1. First increment: Create basic user model → simple API endpoint → minimal UI display
2. Verify: Test the complete flow, ensure build passes
3. Second increment: Add profile editing → update API → edit form UI
4. Verify: Test editing flow, ensure build passes
5. Continue: Add additional profile features incrementally

## Benefits

- Early detection of integration issues
- Continuous working software
- Easier debugging and troubleshooting
- Reduced risk of large-scale rework
- Better progress visibility and feedback
