# Feature Implementation

## Incremental End-to-End Development

- Implement features in small, complete vertical slices spanning all necessary layers
- Each increment should be working, testable functionality
- Verify each increment with builds and tests before proceeding

## Implementation Strategy

- Avoid layer-by-layer development (complete database → complete backend → complete frontend)
- Prefer feature-by-feature development (one small feature across database → backend → frontend, then test)
- Start simple with minimal viable implementation
- Expand incrementally after current slice works

## Verification Between Increments

- Run builds after each increment
- Execute relevant tests to verify feature slice works end-to-end
- Ensure application remains functional before adding next increment
- Fix issues immediately rather than accumulating technical debt

## Example Flow

User profile feature requiring database, API, and UI changes:

1. First increment: Basic user model → simple API endpoint → minimal UI display
2. Verify: Test complete flow, ensure build passes
3. Second increment: Add profile editing → update API → edit form UI
4. Verify: Test editing flow, ensure build passes
5. Continue: Add additional profile features incrementally

## Benefits

- Early detection of integration issues
- Continuous working software
- Easier debugging and troubleshooting
- Reduced risk of large-scale rework
- Better progress visibility and feedback
