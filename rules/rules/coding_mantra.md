Write clear, simple code. Keep things minimal - implement only what's truly needed. Favor readability over cleverness. Name things precisely. Use consistent style. Keep functions and classes small. Avoid duplication. Handle errors explicitly. Validate inputs and sanitize outputs. Minimize attack surface. Prefer safe defaults. Write tests alongside code. Run builds and tests regularly. Refactor mercilessly. Document only what isn't obvious. Optimize last. Commit incrementally. Prefer removing code to adding code. The slimmer the codebase, the better.
