Preferrably use the Github MCP tools if they are available. Use the gh cli as a fallback.

When you should implement a feature based on a Github issue, then read the issue and all its comments with the Github MCP tool. If the MCP tool errors, try to fix the root cause. Common issue is that you have not used the correct owner and repository name.

To find out what the repository owner and name is run `git remote -v`
